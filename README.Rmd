# whitewater.extras

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-brightgreen.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#stable)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of whitewater.extras is to provide _extra_ functionality to the [{whitewater}](https://github.com/joshualerickson/whitewater) through animation and visualization for exploratory data analysis (EDA) or just for fun!

## Warning  

Very new and very unstable so the more issues submitted the better for development and user experience. Thank you!  

## Installation

You can install the development version of whitewater.extras from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("joshualerickson/whitewater.extras")

### will need the current dev version of {whitewater} for now
devtools::install_github("joshualerickson/whitewater")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: look at a hydrograph in different ways.

```{r example}
library(whitewater.extras)
library(whitewater)

#provide a USGS site number that you want to look at visually (we need the data first)
kootenai_river <- ww_dvUSGS(sites = '12305000')

```
**Raster Hydrograph**  

```{r}
ww_raster_hydrograph(daily_values = kootenai_river, value_name = Flow)
```

**Flow Hysteresis**  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
ww_hysteresis_plot(daily_values = kootenai_river, value_name = Flow)
```

**Animation**  

This provides a side-by-side view of a hydrograph per water year and raster hydrograph. 


```{r, eval=F}
ww_animate_hydrograph(daily_values = kootenai_river)
```
